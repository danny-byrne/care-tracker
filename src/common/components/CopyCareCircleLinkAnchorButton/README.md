# CopyCareCircleLinkAnchoredButton Component

## Component Description

This component acts as a 'copy care circle link' button anchored to the bottom of the list of care circle members. When the button is pressed, it turns green and copies the link to the user's clipboard.

## TODO

Update the copyLink function to make a backend call and copy the actual link that the user will share.
